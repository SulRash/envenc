# EnvEnc
Repository for environment encoder


# Ideas

1. Get image encoder output as dense representation to rl agent
2. Get next token prediction of prompt "What should the player do?" from LLM to predict future
3. Profit?

1. Use guidance to force LLM generation into possible agent action space
2. Finetune?
3. Show that fixed dimension prediction to RL agent to constrain search space.
